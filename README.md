## Frontend For Stock Prediction App Using Machine Learning
> This Repo stores the frontend of a Fullstack Web application that predict stock prices of major companies in the United States. 
> It runs the backend and frontend separately as microservices 

### Frontend
- It employs JWT stored as http only cookie for authentication
- It uses Formik along with Yup for form handling and validation
- It utilizes React-Router for routing pages
- It comprises of a user authentication system that use JWT token stored in httponly cookies
- it load chart from cloudinary. this charts are dynamically generated by the backend and saved in cloudinary for quick access
- frontend was deployed to Netlify


### Backend - API
- it uses django rest framework
- It employs JWT stored as http only cookie for authentication
- It uses custom Authentication class
- it dynamically generates chart from the machine learning model and stores in cloudinary for faster access
- The backend was deployed on Render


### Machine Learning
- it uses Neural Network - LSTM for prediction
- Data was splitted into training data, validation data and test data in the ratio 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively
- It made use of scikit-learn, tensorflow and keras libraries
- It generates useful charts for better insight into how well the model did using matplotlib

### Model Evaluation
> The model performed very well when evaluated
- The **Mean Square Error(MSE)** of the model is 15.23
- The **Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)** of the model is 15.23
- The **R-Squared (R2)** is **0.98**
